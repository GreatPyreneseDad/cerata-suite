λ-Weave — CERATA-WEAVE polygon engine (Rose Glass v3)
=====================================================
We do NOT measure similarity. We measure λ.

Input is per-person, per-lens *readings* produced by an LLM reading each person
THROUGH the v3 lens system-prompt (RoseGlassLLMLens) — per-dimension λ (decay),
τ (temporal anchoring), and μ (restoration capacity). This script does the math:
for every candidate polygon under every preset calibration, it computes
**mutual λ-reduction** — how much the table, convened, lowers each member's
effective λ versus that member alone. A constructive table is one whose members
HOLD each other's coherence (provide μ + τ-anchoring on the dimensions where
another is decaying). The right table may only appear under the right lens, so
we compare all presets.

Math is v3's own: tau_attenuated_lambda (λ_eff = λ₀/(1+κτ)) and
lambda_decomposition (λ = w₁λΨ+w₂λρ+w₃λq+w₄λf), with each lens's calibration.

Input (stdin/JSON):
{
  "people": [
    {"id","name",
     "readings": {
        "western_academic":     {"lambda": {"psi","rho","q","f"}, "tau": .., "mu": ..},
        "spiritual_contemplative": {...}, ...   # one per preset the LLM read through
     }}, ...
  ],
  "k": 3, "top": 8
}
Output (JSON): ranked (table, lens) by mutual λ-reduction, with per-member detail.
